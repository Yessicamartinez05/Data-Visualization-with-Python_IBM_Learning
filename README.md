Data Visualization with Python

This repository brings together a collection of examples, scripts, and notebooks focused on data visualization using Python. It includes projects developed during my training in Foundations of Artificial Intelligence with IBM, and it was created as part of my learning process with IBM. Throughout this training, I explored visual analysis techniques applied to real-world problems and hands-on exercises.

The goal of this repository is to build a technical portfolio that demonstrates proficiency in:

Visualization techniques used in descriptive and exploratory analytics

Creating charts with Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Pandas, and NumPy

Visual interpretation oriented toward decision-making

Developing interactive visualizations and customized figures

Applying best practices for visual design in analytical projects

This repository is designed to grow progressively and become a solid resource for data analysis projects, continuous learning, and visual analytics.
